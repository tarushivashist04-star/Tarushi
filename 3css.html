    <h1>Pollution</h1>
    <h2 id="headingO">Over India</h2>
<p id="one">Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the atmosphere that negatively affect human health, animals, and the environment. It is mainly caused by vehicle emissions, industrial smoke, burning of fossil fuels, and deforestation. 
    Pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter reduce air quality and can lead to respiratory diseases, heart problems, and even premature death. Air pollution also contributes to global warming and climate change by increasing greenhouse gases.
    To combat it, we must promote clean energy, plant more trees, and adopt eco-friendly practices. 
    A cleaner atmosphere ensures a healthier and sustainable future for all.</p>
<p id="two">Pollution is one of the most critical challenges facing the modern world, caused primarily by human activities such as industrialization, deforestation, and the burning of fossil fuels.
     It manifests in various forms, including air, water, soil, and noise pollution, each with devastating consequences for the environment and human health. Air pollution, driven by vehicle emissions and factory smoke, leads to respiratory diseases, acid rain, and global warming, which causes polar ice to melt.
      Water pollution from industrial discharge and sewage contaminates drinking water sources and destroys marine life. Furthermore, soil pollution from excessive pesticide use and plastic waste degrades land fertility, affecting food safety. </p>
